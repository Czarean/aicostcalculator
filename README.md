##AI CALLER - MONTHLY CALL COST CALCULATOR

You're welcome to use or modify this calculator as you please! Alternatively, feel free to use this version if you prefer.

About: This calculator will allow you to calculate to the penny how much it will cost you to onboard a client onto BLAND based on the number of calls per month, date, or concurrency.

IMPORTANT: The BLAND packages are also hardcoded, and the calculator will automatically include the price of the package you need to purchase from Bland, and tell you the package that you should purchase! (IÂ´m currently working to add the packages dynamically so you can modify the packages to fit any other vendor specific packages :D)

These are the packages used on this code: 

Basic Plan : No Cost / Default
- **Daily Cap** 500 calls
- **Hourly Cap** 100 calls
- **Concurrency** 10 calls

Build Plan : $299 month
- **Daily Cap 2000** calls
- **Hourly Cap 400**  calls
- **Concurrency 50** calls

Scale Plan : $499 month
- **Daily Cap 5000** calls
- **Hourly Cap 1000**  calls
- **Concurrency 100** calls

Note: If you want you can just copy paste the code of either the calculator.html or calculatorv01.html and paste them on a notepad and save it on your desktop, to have the calculator stored on your computer locally, once done, you can just double click the file and it will open locally on your browser.

(IF YOU SPOT ANY ERROR OR MISCALCULATION LMK AND I WILL FIX IT)
Also if you need help makeing any modification, I will be more than happy to help you with it.
